# PKConnect-4


## Description

Our project is a digital version of the classic board game Connect-4.
It will open as a chatroom for finding games, which when arranged will open up the game UI.
After winning/losing/quitting a game, the user will be returned to the chatroom.
Players will communicate with each other during a game using text chat
